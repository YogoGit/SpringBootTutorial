# Welcome to the SpringBoot for Java!

This tutorial will help teach you how to build Java web applications using
SpringBoot 3.

Before you get started, you will need to install [java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

I recommend installing Java 21, as it's the most compatible LTS (Long Term Support)
release version of Java as of the time this file was written, which should
be valid throughout the entire semester.

These installs may require you to update your PATH, which is done differently
in Windows or the Mac. Those details are not provided in this tutorial.

Test that the `java` command works by running:

    java -version

You should see text displaying the version of java installed. If you do not,
ensure you have java installed and referenced in your PATH.

Optionally, you can also install/use an IDE such as [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/)
or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) to provide an more
robust programming environment. Note, I recommend the Ultimate version of the
latter, which is use by many commercial developers, but is free for
students/teachers, see [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)
for details on obtaining an educational license.

Alright! You are ready to go!


Create a new project
--------------------

The initial documentation is heavily influenced by the following sites:

* [quickstart](https://spring.io/quickstart)
* [spring-boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/)
* [IntelliJ](https://spring.io/guides/gs/intellij-idea/)

Or, you can choose to follow this guide, which is MUCH more comprehensive.

---

Create a new Spring Boot Project by going to <https://start.spring.io/>

* Project - Gradle - Groovy
* Language - Java
* Spring Boot - 3.5.4
* Project Metadata
  - Group: edu.carroll
  - Artifact: cs341-demo
  - Name: cs341
  - Description: CS341 project for Spring Boot
  - Package name: edu.carroll.cs341
  - Packaging: Jar
  - Java: 21

Next, in the upper-left corner of the screen, Click on the 'Add dependencies'
button, and scroll down until you see 'Spring Web', and then click to add it.

Finally, click the 'GENERATE' button at the bottom of the page, which should
create and then download the file cs341-demo.zip onto your laptop.

Bring up a command line window and browse to the directory for projects
in this class) (either create a new directory or use an existing directory).

Once in that directory, unpack the file in the top-level directory, which
should create a new folder named cs341-demo containing the basic configuration
for your demo project.

In the newly created `cs341-demo` directory create a new git repository by running:

    cd cs341-demo
    git init

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

At this point, I would *HIGHLY* recommend creating a new Github repository
associated with your personal Github account, and then upload this project
to github before proceeding. Instructions on how to accomplish this are
not included in this tutorial.

Throughout this tutorial you will be able to check your progress against the
official tutorial.  To do this add the official tutorial as a new git remote
named `upstream` by running:

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/YogoGit/SpringBootTutorial.git


Fetch the remote repository:

    git fetch upstream --tags


Set up an IDE
-------------

Before we do anything else, let's bring the project into our IDE.

Since the preferred IDE for this class is IntelliJ due to it being the more
likely IDE used by professional Java developes, I'll only provide the
most basic instructions to use it.

In IntelliJ, select 'File -> New -> Projects from Existing Sources', and then
browse to the folder where the **cs341-demo** folder repository is located.
Click on the **cs341-demo** name (do NOT double-click it), then select
'Open', which should allow IntelliJ to setup and configure the project.

In the next screen, choose 'Import project from external model', and choose
the 'Gradle' icon below it, then finally, select 'Create'.

![Import Image](image/GradleImport.jpg?raw=true "GradleImport")

You *may* have to enable gradle on the project by selecting the bell icon
on the far left, and then enable Gradle (why, who knows?).

For Eclipse, there are more instructions and plugins needed. The following
article should get you started <https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2018/february/springboot.php>.

Create a Simple Web Application
-------------------------------

Now you can create a web controller for this simple web application, as the
following (src/main/java/edu/carroll/cs341/HelloController.java):

    package edu.carroll.cs341;

    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

    @RestController
    public class HelloController {
        @GetMapping("/")
        public String index() {
            return "Greetings from Spring Boot!";
        }
    }

Running Application
-------------------

To run the application from the command line, it's a simple matter of running
gradle in the project directory

    gradlew bootRun

The command should be the same whether you are using Windows or MacOS.  (Note,
on MacOS, you *may* need to provide the path as './gradlew' to start it up.

The FIRST TIME you do this, it will download all of the dependencies for
the project, which may take a bit. However, startup time for subsequent runs
will be much faster as the downloads are all cached locally.

After starting, you should eventually see a line that looks similar to the
following.

    2022-12-28T13:26:17.102-07:00  INFO 9483 --- [           main] edu.carroll.cs341.Cs341Application       : Started Cs341Application in 0.998 seconds (process running for 1.219)

Open the following URL in your browser to verify the app is working:
<http://localhost:8080>

This should now return the text from the HelloController we coded above, as
well as verify that your environment and dependencies are all setup properly.
